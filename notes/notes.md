## Abstract over interfaces

1. interfaces are used for composition.
2. interfaces offer a <i><b>can do</b></i> relationship, while abstract class offers a <i><b>is a</b></i> relationship
4. e.g. i can IDrive, while IDrive a car which is a Maruti Suzuki

## Events and delegates

1. delegates are like function pointers
2. events represent an action which has happened
3. events encapsulate delegates - cannot invoke delegates from classes outside the class it is declared
4. using #1 delegates can be used decouple things as compared to methods which are tightly coupled
