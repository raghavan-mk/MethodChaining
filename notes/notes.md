## Abstract over interfaces

1. interfaces are used for composition.
2. interfaces offer a <i><b>can do</b></i> relationship, while abstract class offers a <i><b>is a</b></i> relationship
3. e.g. i can IDrive, while IDrive a car which is a Maruti Suzuki

## Abstraction and encapsulation

1. Abstraction is an idea/concept solving design level problems. Encapsulation is implementing the idea for others(clients) to consume solving implementation problems
2. Encapsulation is about protecting/hide information from users so as to maintain it in a consistent state/
3. Encapsulation is exposing complexity in a fail safe manner

## Events and delegates

1. delegates are like function pointers
2. events represent an action which has happened
3. events encapsulate delegates - cannot invoke delegates from classes outside the class it is declared
4. using #1 delegates can be used decouple things as compared to methods which are tightly coupled

## Software Architecture

1. Process of putting a structure to requirements. Requirements like maintainability, scalabality, feasibility etc meeting tech and business requirements. E.g Client server, serverless, event driven, layered  etc 
2. Layered architecture - separation of concerns 

## Engineering

1. Structuring things - cohesive whole built up as distinct parts ? As well may use for Architecture ? And Organizing things -like bringing it to a working order ? Structure - client and server architecture. The organize individual components in each structure to get it working ?

## Higher order functions

In JavaScript, functions are objects. Because of this, ***functions can take functions as arguments, and can be returned by other functions. Functions that do this are called higher-order functions. Any function that is passed as an argument is called a callback function.***

## Normalization of deviance 

## Code complexity

1. Number of lines code ?
2. How frequently are they changed?
3. Make better use of static code analyzers

## Visualization

1. Power law distribution 

## Microservices

1. Each service represents a business capability 

## Encapsulation

1. Implementation hiding ? 
2. Remove code smell
3.
